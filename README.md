# GitHub and BitBucket support for add-on installer
#### xenforoaddon_AddOnInstallerExtendsGithubBitbucket

`This add-on is abandoned before development was finished; it could install from URL, but it did not upgrade automatically.`

### Abandon Date

2016-08-07

### Motivation

I consider easier committing and pushing into a Git repository than doing the whole upgrade process.

### Demotivation

[XenForo](https://xenforo.com/) is a proprietary platform. The owner of the board for who I made a series of add-ons for him moved to [IPS](https://invisioncommunity.com/), another platform.
